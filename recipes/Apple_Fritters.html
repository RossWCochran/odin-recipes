    <img src="../pictures/Apple_Fritters.png" alt="Apple Fritters">
    <p>Boy howdy kiddos! Do you remember season 3 episode 38 of the 
        <i>Regular Show</i> first airing August 27, 2012? Of course you do!
        Then no doubt you remember the dangerous and delicious <strong>Double
            Glazed Apple Fritters</strong>.  For too long these 'nOt SaFe FoR
            hUmAn CoNsUmPtIoN' (BS) treats have been more like 'not 
            <i>available </i> for human consumption'. 
    </p>
    <p>
        However, after 7 long years, Andrew Rea from the YouTube channel 
        <i>Binging with Babish</i> has ended our collective suffering 
        with his wonderful version of this Cartoon Network pastry.

        <ul>Dough
            <li>1 ¾ cup milk (heated to 110°F)</li>
            <li>2 ¼  tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp honey</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>22 ⅓ ounces all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 ½ sticks unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>

        </ul>
        <ul>Apple Filling
            <li>4 large Granny Smith apples</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>½ stick of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ tsp cloves</li>
            <li>½ tsp ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ tsp allspice</li>
            <li>1 tsp cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Glaze
            <li>2 ½ cups powdered sugar (or more, if you want an extra thick glaze)</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>Recipe
        <li>To make the doughnuts, whisk warmed milk, yest, sugar, 
            and honey for 10 minutes. To this add flour, eggs, and 
            cubed butter.</li>
        <li>Using a stand mixer, stir for 7-8 minutes, occationally scraping 
            down the bowel's sides.</li>
        <li>Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>During this time, chop your apples and coat the large chunks in 
            lemon juice.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat the butter on medium heat until lightly 
            browned. At this point add the apple pieces and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Add cloves, ginger, cinnamon and allspice and stir for 4-5 minutes</li>
        <li>Separately mix water and cornstarch, then add to the pan, letting it 
            sit once stirred.</li>
        <li>Empty your risen dough on a well floured surface and spread into a 
            large rectangle.</li>
        <li>Spread the cooled applie filling evenly across the dough</li>
        <li>Fold the dough into thirds, manipulate into a new bowl, and let rise for 
            1 hour.</li>
        <li>Again empty the dough onto a floured work surface and flatten to 1 in 
            thickness. Cut out individual fritters, re-rolling, flattening, and cutting
                until all the dough is used.</li>
        <li>Fry the dough in 375&deg;F for 90 seconds on each side (180 sec total), and 
            let cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Combine a lot of powdered sugar (about 2 ½ cups) and a little bit of milk 
            (about ¼ cup) and whisk until smooth. </li>
        <li>Dunk each fritter into the glaze and let rest back on the rack. Once the first 
            coat has hardened, go in and dunk each fritter again for a double glaze. </li>
        <li>If you want to make a thicker glaze, double the amount of powdered sugar and 
            use the same amount of milk for an extra thick honey bun-esque glaze.</li>
