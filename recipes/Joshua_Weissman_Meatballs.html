            <li> ¼ lb (123g) finely chopped mortadella</li>
            <li> 1 lb (454g) ground beef</li>
            <li> 1 tsp (2g) finely ground fennel seed (optional)</li>
            <li> 1 ¾  tsp (12g) fine sea salt</li>
            <li> 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup (20g) fresh grated pecorino or parmesan</li>
            <li> black pepper to taste</li>
            <li> ½  cup (35g) panko bread crumbs crushed tell mostly fine</li>
            <li> 1 whole egg</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, place your chopped mortadella, combine it with the ground beef, 
                fennel seed, salt, garlic, parmesan cheese, and black pepper, mix it well, 
                and add the panko and eggs and mix again until emulsified and tacky. </li>
            <li>Use a large cookie scoop to make the meatballs, around twenty, place them on a 
                sheet tray and roll them into balls. </li>
            <li>In a large sautee pan, over medium-high, pour enough olive oil to cover the
                 bottom of the pan; once the oil is hot, add all the meatballs in one single 
                 layer, and sear for about two minutes, flip and sear one or two more sides, 
                 until golden brown. (it’s okay if there are not cook all the way) Remove the 
                 meatballs from the pan and reserve.</li>
        </ol>
