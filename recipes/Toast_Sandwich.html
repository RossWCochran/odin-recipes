    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you have read either of my two previous recipes you
         already <em>KNOW</em> that I don't fucking miss. That's 
         for chumps and, unfortunately, I'm a champ. I have 
         given you banger after banger; fuckin' off the wall, 
        welcome to flaver-town, here's the lamb sauce flavor. 
        So when your old pal Ross says he's go 1 last recipe, 
        you best listen up!</p>
    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the <strong>Bread Sandwich</strong></p>
    <ul>For this recipe you will need:
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>salt (optional)</li>
        <li>Peper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Select 3 slices of bread. Each can be from the same 
            loaf or different loaves if you are feeling a 
            bit frisky.</li>
        <li>Select 1 slice and toast once at your preferred 
            toaster setting. I recommend using the densest
             slice.</li>
        <li>When completed, butter each side and, should you 
            want and extra kick, salt and/or pepper each side
            <i>lightly</i>(particularly if the butter is salted).</li>
        <li>Layer the bread and toast in the following order: 
        bread, toast, bread.</li>
        <li>Done! Enjoy your flavorful and filling snack!</li>
    </ol>
